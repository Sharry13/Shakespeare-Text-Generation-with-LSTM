# Shakespeare-Text-Generation-with-LSTM

Welcome to the Shakespeare Text Generator project! This project aims to generate Shakespearean-style text using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Dive into the world of Shakespearean literature and experience the magic of language generation with modern deep learning techniques.

# About the Project

# Objective: 

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of LSTM neural networks in generating text that resembles the style and language of William Shakespeare.

# Architecture: 

The model architecture consists of an LSTM layer followed by a softmax activation function in the output layer. The model is trained on a corpus of Shakespearean texts to learn the patterns and structure of his language.

# Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow
Keras

# How it Works

# Data Preparation: 

The project starts with preprocessing and tokenizing the Shakespearean text corpus. This step involves converting the raw text into a format suitable for training the LSTM model.

# Model Training: 

The LSTM model is trained on the preprocessed text data to learn the underlying patterns and language structures present in Shakespeare's writings.
Text Generation: Once trained, the LSTM model is capable of generating new text in the style of Shakespeare. By providing a seed text or starting sequence, the model predicts the next words in the sequence, resulting in the generation of coherent and stylistically consistent text.
